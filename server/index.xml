As Shoko Server uses a Web UI, nothing will initially open so you&amp;rsquo;ll need to click on the Shoko Server icon in your tray and click Web UI to open the browser based UI. You can also access the Web UI by typing in http://localhost:8111/ in your browser&amp;rsquo;s address bar.</description></item><item><title>Installing Shoko Server</title><link>https://docs.shokoanime.com/server/install/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.shokoanime.com/server/install/</guid><description>Is Shoko Server Mandatory? The short answer, Yes.
Shoko Server is where all the magic happens. It acts as a central database for every program and plugin under the Shoko suite allowing you to access, maintain and watch your anime collection. This also means that Shoko Server must be running to use any other program or plugin that connect to it. Outside of file importing, Shoko Server is no more resource intensive than other programs you probably have running in the background, so you don&amp;rsquo;t need to worry about Shoko Server eating up resources.</description></item></channel></rss>
